# Moodline

Moodline is a prototype application designed to help students manage their academic deadlines by integrating features of the Moodle platform. This MVP provides users with notification-based reminders for assignment due dates, quizzes.

## Features

- **Deadline Notifications**: Receive reminders for upcoming assignments and quizzes.
- **Calendar Integration**: View a calendar of upcoming deadlines.
- **Group Task Management**: Assign and track tasks for group projects (prototype-only).

> **Note**: This project is a prototype, and no real Moodle API or data integration has been used. All content is generated to simulate the intended functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: Make sure you have Git installed. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **MacOS**: Only Xcode users can run this program.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoodleApp.git
   cd MoodleApp
   ```

2. Run the app.

## Usage

1. Open the application interface.
2. Use the provided menus to view upcoming deadlines, set tasks, or view grades.
3. Since this is a prototype, some features are mock-ups meant to represent the final vision of the application.

## Limitations

- **Prototype-Only**: This is an MVP prototype without real integration with Moodle.
- **No Real Data**: All notifications, deadlines, and tasks are simulated.
- **Limited Functionality**: Designed mainly for showcasing the app's user interface and basic workflow.
